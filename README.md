1. What are the fundamental concepts of version control and why is GitHub popular for managing versions of code? How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
ANSWER:
Version control systems track and manage changes to code, enabling collaboration without conflicts. GitHub is popular for its integration with Git and its collaborative features. It maintains project integrity by tracking changes, enabling rollbacks, and supporting collaboration.


2. Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some important decisions to make during this process?
ANSWER: 
1. Click “New” in GitHub repositories.
2. Name your repository and add a description.
3. Choose visibility: public or private.
4. Optionally initialize with a README, .gitignore, and a license.

Key decisions include repository visibility and initial files.



3. Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
ANSWER:
The README provides project details, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. It helps collaborators understand and contribute effectively by offering clear guidance on the project


4. Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
ANSWER: 
Public repositories are open to everyone, encouraging collaboration but exposing code. Private repositories restrict access, providing more control but limiting external feedback.


5. Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
ANSWER: 
1. Make changes to files.
2. Stage with `git add`.
3. Commit with `git commit -m "Message"`.
4. Push with `git push`.

Commits track changes and manage project versions.



6. How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
ANSWER:
Branching allows parallel development. Create a branch with `git branch`, switch with `git checkout`, commit changes, and merge with `git merge`. It helps manage multiple features or fixes simultaneously.


7. Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
ANSWER:
Pull requests enable code review and collaboration. Create a pull request by pushing a branch and opening a request on GitHub. Review, discuss, and merge changes once approved.


8. Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
ANSWER:
Forking creates a personal copy of a repository for independent work. Cloning creates a local copy of the repository. Forking is useful for contributing to projects you don’t directly control.


9. Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
ANSWER:
Issues track bugs and tasks; project boards organize them. They help prioritize and manage work, improving collaboration by making tasks and progress visible.


10. Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
ANSWER:
Common challenges include merging conflicts and understanding branching. Best practices include frequent, clear commits, regular syncing, using branches effectively, and reviewing pull requests to ensure code quality and collaboration.
